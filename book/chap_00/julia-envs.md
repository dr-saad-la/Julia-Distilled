# Advanced Setup


## Installing Julia Package and Adding New Julia Environments

## Setting up the Julia Environment

Once Julia is installed, the next step is to set up the Julia environment. This involves installing packages and setting up a code editor or IDE.

## Installing Packages

Julia has a built-in package manager that makes it easy to install and manage packages. To install a package, open the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) by typing `julia` in a terminal or command prompt. Once the REPL is open, type `]` to enter package mode. Then, type `add PackageName` to install a package. For example, to install the Plots package, type:
```julia
] add Plots
```
